In this paper we implemented three separate FPGA-accelerated cryptography projects
The first algorithm, AES, a symmetric key cryptography algorithm, was a good candidate for FPGA acceleration,
since you can encrypt any number of blocks in parallel.
In practice, we saw that our FPGA-accelerated implementation beat the ZedBoard ARM CPU outright.
While it did not beat the ecelinux Intel CPU in raw performance, it did outperform it in price-to-performance and power-to-performance ratios.
Our second algorithm, RSA, is a public-key cryptosystem.
It was not amenable to an FPGA implementation, as there was little parallelism to exploit.
It was far slower than an optimized software version, even on the ZedBoard.
However, RSA is also not a good candidate for acceleration because it is most often used not to encrypt large amounts of data, but to encrypt keys to allow a
symmetric algorithm, like AES, to encrypt large amounts of data.
Thus, the potential speedup gained by accelerating RSA is fairly small.
Our last project was to implement a Unix Password Cracker based around SHA-512.
The process for hashing Linux passwords is computationally expensive and centers on 5000 rounds of SHA-512.
We offloaded this entire computation onto the FPGA, and then used a host program to send commonly used passwords to the FPGA to hash in a dictionary-style attack.
Our implementation beat the ZedBoard ARM CPU and lost to the ecelinux Intel CPU, but like AES, our FPGA-based
design is significantly better than the other platforms tested in terms of price-to-performance and
power-to-performance.
