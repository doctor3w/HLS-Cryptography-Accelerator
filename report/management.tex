\section{Project Management}
% This section should clearly identify the work division among the students in
% the group using a project timeline that lists the tasks and milestones of the project, the member(s) of
% the group responsible for each task, and the actual completion date of each task. This section should
% contain a description of how the overall project developed and any successes and/or challenges during
% the course of the project.
